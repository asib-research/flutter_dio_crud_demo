# Flutter Dio CRUD Demo

This project demonstrates a clean and maintainable approach to performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in Flutter using the Dio HTTP client library.

It is designed for developers who want to understand professional-grade API integration patterns, error handling, and service layer abstraction in Flutter.

---

## Overview

This repository uses the public fake REST API [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) to simulate CRUD operations without requiring a backend setup.

The implementation focuses on:
- Layered architecture (API service abstraction)
- Dio configuration and interceptors
- Centralized error handling
- Clean and maintainable code structure

---

## Features

- GET all posts
- GET a single post by ID
- POST a new post
- PUT update an existing post
- DELETE a post
- Global error handling and logging
- Base service architecture for scalability

---

## Tech Stack

- **Flutter** (stable channel)
- **Dio** for HTTP requests
- **JSONPlaceholder** as the mock REST API
